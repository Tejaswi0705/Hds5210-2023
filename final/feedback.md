**(-1) What was the purpose of hte circle at 25,35 with radius 10?  It's great to be able to draw on your chart, but if there's no statistical significance to that region, you shouldn't highlight it.**

**Note that with markdown, if you want to make something a heading, you have to have a space between the hash symbols and the heading text. `## Heading`**

**Overall, this was a great final project. Nice work!!**
